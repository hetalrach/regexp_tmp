# regexp_tmp


This is a script based regular expressions tutorial which will help you learn
regular expressions. There are different levels, each level has a write-up, 
it's input file and then an output file.

./run_regexp.sh is how you would run it.

The command line parameters are as follows.

Set: -s <set_number>

Start with 1, and move on till you are done with all sets.

All the other parameters below have to come in with -s <set_number>

Write-up: -w # Shows the writeup associated with that particular set

input: -i #Shows the input file

output: -o #Shows the output file

test: -t #Runs a test. Will ask you for a regular expression, run it, find the output and compare it to the standard output.
